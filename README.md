# `multibergm`: Fit multiple networks using Bayesian exponential random graph models

`multibergm` provides a set of tools to perform Bayesian parameter estimation of
a multilevel framework for populations of networks based on exponential random graph models. 
By pooling information across the individual networks, the framework provides a principled approach 
to characterise the relational structure for an entire population.
