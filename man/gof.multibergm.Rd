\arguments{
\item{object}{A \link{multibergm} object}

\item{coefs}{Optional set of model coefficients to use for network
simulation. The default is to use the posterior samples of the
population-level parameter.}

\item{sample_size}{Number of networks to be simulated and compared to the
observed networks.}

\item{aux_iters}{Number of iterations used for network simulation.}

\item{burn_in}{Amount of burn-in to remove from the start of posterior
samples (pre-thinning)}

\item{thin}{Amount of thinning to apply to the posterior samples}

\item{...}{Additional parameters to be passed on to lower-level functions.}
}
\value{
Outputs bar plots (for observed networks) overlayed with ribbons
  (for simulated network) of degree, minimum geodesic distances,
  and edge-wise shared partner distributions.
}
\description{
Function to calculate summaries for degree, minimum geodesic distances,
and edge-wise shared partner distributions to diagnose the Bayesian
goodness-of-fit of exponential random graph models fit to multiple
networks.
